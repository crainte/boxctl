# Boxctl
Wrapper for machinectl and systemctl to manage systemd-nspawn OS containers with a 
prescriptive way to cutover to new images and fallback to old ones (without depending
on BTRFS or ZFS). OverlayFS is used to maintain control over changes from the original 
image.

Note: this is a work in progress, so it is not stable yet.

## Dependencies
